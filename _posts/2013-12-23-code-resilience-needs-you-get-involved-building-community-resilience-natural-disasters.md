As we celebrate the holiday season and assemble our wish list for the New Year, the Code for Resilience Team is thinking about innovative ways to strengthen the resilience of communities most vulnerable to natural disasters.
 
And we’ve got some ideas about how you can help.
 
Last month we launched www.CodeForResilience.org, a project supported by the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and ICT Unit (TWICT), and Code for Japan. The project aims to increase the availability of “civic technologies”—or ICT-based tools built by, with, and for local communities—that can help strengthen preparedness for and mitigation of the risks of natural hazards like floods, earthquakes, cyclones and droughts.

In these early days of the Code for Resilience project, there are several important ways that you can get involved:
 
1.     Contribute a problem statement. Do you have first-hand knowledge of natural hazards that affect developing countries?  Submit your crisis-need-impact statement here. 
2.     Contribute to the app repository. Code for Resilience is collecting information about apps and deployment instances that relate to disaster risk management. Submit you app or deployment example, or comment on apps currently posted in the app repository here.
3.     Partner with us. Does your organization have data sets, tool kits and/or expertise to share? Read about us and learn how to partner here.
Stay tuned for announcements about Code for Resilience events early in the New Year. We’ll have hackathons in cities across Asia, followed by an online innovation challenge through which participating teams will receive mentorship support. It will all culminate with grand prize winners of the online innovation challenge being recognized on stage at the Understanding Risk conference in London in July. 
There are lots of reasons to get involved, and plenty of ways you can engage. So join us: we look forward to collaborating with you!
