Hackers from Peshawar, Pakistan, to Port-au-Prince, Haiti, have joined the Code for Resilience movement by putting their technical skills to use against dozens of locally identified disaster resilience challenges.

The result?

Nearly 1,000 Code for Resilience hackers participating in events in six cities, producing over 40 projects that provide a wide range of IT-based solutions like shelter identification and tracking, severe weather and other emergency alerts, gamified disaster preparedness information for children, and many more.

But we’re not done yet.

In the coming weeks local organizers in four additional Asian countries will host Code for Resilience hackathon events:

Manila, the Philippines: From Friday, May 9 through Sunday, May 11 Code for Resilience will join partners in the Philippines to host the Readysaster Hack for Resilience, where developers, data geeks, and designers will collaborate to create web/mobile apps that can be used to empower communities to take a proactive role in preparing for and reduce the risks from natural disasters.
Bangalore, India:  From Saturday, May 10 through Sunday, May 11 Code for Resilience will join Code for India and other partners to co-host a simultaneous, parallel hackathon event for developers in Bangalore and Mountain View, California. Disaster resilience will be one of the key themes addressed by the hackathon. Keynote speakers will include Infosys Co-Founder and Chairman Emeritus, N.R. Narayan Murthy and Google Inc., Senior Vice President Amit Singhal.
We’re also in the final stages of organizing events in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Hanoi, Vietnam. Stay tuned as we’ll post more information about those events here soon.

And remember, participating hacker teams who upload their apps to the Code for Resilience website before the deadline are eligible to participate in the Online Innovation Challenge. Grand prize winners will be flown to London, England, to pitch their concepts to an audience of over 800 disaster risk management experts gathering for the Understanding Risk conference.
