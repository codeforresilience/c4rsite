Haiti 2015
==========

Haiti is highly exposed to multiple natural hazards and 96% of its population lives at risk. The 7.0 magnitude earthquake that hit Haiti in January 2010 killed up to 230,000 people, and caused an estimated US$8 billion in damages and losses. 

The country’s economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which produces more than 25% of the national GDP and is the main source of revenue for rural households.  However, only 1% of farmers use irrigation, and understanding rainfall is crucial for the vast majority of farmers to grow crops used as their primary source of food and income.

These farmers, and the country as a whole, are in need of a system that collects reliable hydrological and meteorological data. This information would be useful in facilitating the required coordination with national and local early warning systems to help protect lives and livelihoods.

To prepare for, and respond to, natural disasters the Haitian Government and Civil Society organizations must have the relevant data available for prompt assessments and response as well as for planning and preparedness. Much of Haiti’s disaster risk data, however, is available only in hard copy or distributed in PDF format. This makes it difficult for different government agencies, to produce, distribute, and use geospatial data analysis and other products in the timeframe needed to support rapid and effective decision-making. 

Building on the momentum established in 2014 through Konbit Teknolojik pou Rezilyans (Code for Resilience Haiti), this year, the program is working to reduce disaster risk through hydromet technology with SMS Lapli (which means "SMS rain" in Haitian Creole). 

This open source application is just the first module of a national data platform allowing different hydromet networks in the country to work together. SMS Lapli will help the newly created Hydromet Unit at the Ministry of Agriculture to systematically collect, analyze, archive and disseminate rainfall data from more than 100 agro-meteorological stations across the country.

Through smart application of technology and strong partnerships between scientists, civil society groups, governments and development institutions, vulnerable communities can better protect lives and safeguard economic progress.
