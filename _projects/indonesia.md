Jakarta, Indonesia
==================

With a population of more than 8.5 million, Jakarta is a megacity regularly inundated by flooding. To assess impacts post-flood, Damage and Loss Assessments (DaLA) are carried out, which, ideally, are automated. In Jakarta, however, data collection is done manually.

To address this challenge, in 2014 one of the focuses of the coding event was adapting existing open source tools to effectively collect, analyze, and assess the impact from floods using geospatial data.

In 2015, CfR Fellows will build upon the work from 2014 to further develop Jakarta InaSAFE. This prototype framework of DaLA tools modifies the existing Indonesia Scenarios Assessment for Emergencies (InaSAFE) to integrate basic features with different systems used by Jakarta’s Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) and automate the creation of DaLA data to estimate direct damage and losses incurred by flooding in Jakarta. 

Forward-thinking initiatives like these will be an important part of efforts to help communities prepare for the effects of climate change and reduce risk to natural disasters.
