In Togo, heavy flooding costs millions of West African CFA francs in losses and damages each year. Timely, simple, and accurate forecasts tools that collect, process, and disseminate data in a timely and reliable manner are key. Currently, however, the country lacks such information, as data management is completed manually and there is no platform to store it. 
 
Code for Resilience (CfR) has partnered with the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre (RCCC) to  develop a hydrological model embedded in a digital platform to support early warning and early action in Togo’s Mono River Basin.
This project aims to develop an SMS-based system for pluviometer data collection upstream and downstream of the dam, which will also support the establishment of a forecast-based financing project for disaster preparedness around the Nangbeto Dam on the Mono river basin. 

Since 2014 Code for Resilience has connected civil society, governments, and technologists through events, mentorship, and code sprint activities to accelerate community’s resilience to natural disasters.
