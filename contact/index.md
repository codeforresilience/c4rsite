====================================

Building on the momentum established in 2014 through 10 hackathon events in 8 countries that engaged over 1,000 participants, this year Code for Resilience (CfR) is introducing fellowship opportunities to further promote the use of open data and build a sustained community of open source software developers for collecting, analyzing, sharing, and improving risk data for better decision-making.
